<p class="main_intro">
My name is Alex Salazar and I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology. During my undergraduate and post-graduate years I conducted research on protein structures using computational models. This was my first time ever being exposed to programming and computer science theory. I immediately got hooked and ended spending more time on this than my actual research. It\'s funny how things work out sometimes.

The purpose of this site is to share some of my small projects and ideas with everyone. The tutorials are something I am specially looking forward to writing. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to save up some money in order to spend a couple months purely studying and travel a bit. This is honestly my passion and I\'d like share my knowledge with others. Everyday I strive to get better. I am by no means an expert but hopefully make a small impact in others\' learning. <br></br> 
PS:: I just created this site Nov 2016 so please be patient &#9786;
