This is one of the first versions of the main content in my static site. The main purpose of this is to serve as a reference for those creating their own profile page. Unlike most of my projects' code, this code is not well commented so if you have any questions please feel free to email me and I would be more than happy to comment on the code and update the project on github.

he actual implemented version can be found at http://asalazar.net
